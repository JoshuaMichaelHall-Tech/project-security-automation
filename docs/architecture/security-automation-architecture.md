# Security Automation Architecture

## Overview

The Security Automation Suite for Financial Services implements a comprehensive security and compliance framework designed specifically for regulated financial environments. The architecture follows defense-in-depth principles with automated validation, continuous monitoring, and compliance evidence collection.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Zero-Trust Security Model
- All components assume breach and verify continuously
- Least privilege access controls throughout the system
- Continuous authentication and authorization validation

### 2. Compliance by Design
- Regulatory requirements embedded in automation
- Continuous compliance validation and evidence collection
- Automated controls for SOX, PCI-DSS, GDPR, and FINRA

### 3. Security Integration
- Security validation integrated at every pipeline stage
- Automated security testing and vulnerability assessment
- Continuous security monitoring and threat detection

## Core Components

### Infrastructure Security Layer

#### Terraform Security Validation

### CI/CD Security Integration

#### Security Gates
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Security validation before code commit
- **Pipeline Security**: Security scanning at every pipeline stage
- **Deployment Validation**: Security checks before production deployment
- **Rollback Capabilities**: Automated rollback on security failures

## Data Flow Architecture

### 1. Code Security Validation
```
Developer Commit → Pre-commit Security Hooks → Code Repository
                ↓
        Security Pipeline Triggers → tfsec/Checkov Scanning
                ↓
        Security Findings → Security Hub → Alert/Block Pipeline
```

### 2. Infrastructure Deployment
```
Terraform Plan → Security Validation → Policy Check → Deploy
                ↓
        AWS Config Rules → Compliance Check → Evidence Collection
                ↓
        Security Hub → Monitoring → Alerting
```

### 3. Container Security Flow
```
Container Build → Vulnerability Scan → Policy Check → Registry Push
                ↓
        Kubernetes Deploy → Runtime Security → Network Policies
                ↓
        Monitoring → Threat Detection → Incident Response
```

### 4. Compliance Automation
```
Resource Deployment → Config Rules → Compliance Check
                ↓
        Evidence Collection → Secure Storage → Audit Reports
                ↓
        Dashboard Updates → Alert Generation → Remediation
```
